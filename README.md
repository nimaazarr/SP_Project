## Exploring Stochastic Processes: From Basics to Advanced Applications

### Instructor: Dr. Peyvandi

Welcome to this comprehensive project on stochastic processes. This repository delves into various fundamental and advanced concepts that underpin stochastic processes, including Gaussian distributions, Gaussian processes, Brownian motion, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. It provides practical implementations and insights into each area through Jupyter notebooks and datasets.

What You Will Learn and Do

1.  Gaussian Distributions: Fit univariate and multivariate Gaussian distributions to data and interpret the results.
2.	Gaussian Processes: Generate Gaussian processes using specific mean functions and kernels, visualizing different realizations to understand their variability.
3.	Brownian Motion: Explore the characteristics of Brownian motion, simulate its trajectories, and apply detrending methods to analyze its behavior.
4.	Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): Dive into MCMC, starting with simple toy datasets and progressing to complex models. Learn about the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, set up and visualize MCMC chains, and extend your knowledge to fit quadratic models.

Each section includes theoretical explanations followed by practical exercises that require you to implement and visualize the results using Python. The exercises are designed to enhance your understanding of stochastic modeling and provide hands-on experience with real-world data.

Instructions:

1.	Read each section carefully to grasp the theory behind each stochastic process.
2.	Complete the coding exercises: Fill in the code sections marked with ... and pass to perform data manipulation, model fitting, and analysis.
3.	Implement and design your own visualizations: No visualization code is provided. You are encouraged to design your own methods to visualize and interpret the data effectively.
4.	Reflect on your findings: Answer the questions provided at the end of each section to reflect on the behaviors and characteristics of each process.

Dataset:

The repository includes specific datasets (e.g., data1.npy, data2.npy). Load and examine each dataset as instructed to understand its distribution and characteristics before applying any stochastic models.

Tools and Libraries:

Ensure you have all necessary Python libraries installed, including numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scipy, and sklearn. These tools are crucial for the calculations and visualizations you will need to perform.

Project Structure

•	Gaussian Distribution Fitting: Fit and visualize univariate and bivariate distributions.  
•	Simulating and Visualizing Gaussian and Brownian Processes: Understand the stochastic nature through visualization.  
•	Implementing and Visualizing MCMC: From basic implementations to exploring parameter uncertainties and model fittings.  
•	Extending MCMC to Complex Models: Apply what you have learned to more complex scenarios, enhancing both the model and the fitting process.

By the end of this project, you will have a solid foundation in handling stochastic processes analytically and computationally. Embark on this analytical journey with enthusiasm and curiosity. Good luck!

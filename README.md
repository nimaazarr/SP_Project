# Exploring Stochastic Processes: From Basics to Advanced Applications

**Instructor: Dr. Peyvandi**

Welcome to this comprehensive project on stochastic processes. In this notebook, we delve into various fundamental and advanced concepts that underpin stochastic processes. We cover Gaussian distributions, Gaussian processes, Brownian motion, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, providing practical implementations and insights into each area.

## What We Will Do
1. **Gaussian Distributions**: You'll start with univariate and multivariate Gaussian distributions, learning how to fit these models to data and interpret the results.
2. **Gaussian Processes**: You will generate Gaussian processes using specific mean functions and kernels, visualizing different realizations to understand their variability.
3. **Brownian Motion**: Explore the characteristics of Brownian motion, simulate its trajectories, and apply detrending methods to analyze its behavior.
4. **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**: Dive into MCMC, starting with a simple toy dataset and progressing to complex models. Learn about the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, understand how to set up and visualize MCMC chains, and extend your knowledge to fit quadratic models.

Each section includes theoretical explanations followed by practical exercises that require you to implement and visualize the results using Python. The exercises are designed to enhance your understanding of stochastic modeling and provide hands-on experience with real-world data.

## Dataset:
We will work with specific datasets provided within the notebook (e.g., `data1.npy`). Load and examine each dataset as instructed to understand its distribution and characteristics before applying any stochastic models.

## Tools and Libraries:
Before we begin, ensure you have all necessary Python libraries installed, including `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `scipy`, and `sklearn`. These tools are crucial for the calculations and visualizations you will need to perform.

## Project Structure
- **Gaussian Distribution Fitting**: Fit and visualize univariate and bivariate distributions.
- **Simulating and Visualizing Gaussian and Brownian Processes**: Understand the stochastic nature through visualization.
- **Implementing and Visualizing MCMC**: From basic implementations to exploring parameter uncertainties and model fittings.
- **Extending MCMC to Complex Models**: Apply what you have learned to more complex scenarios, enhancing both the model and the fitting process.

By the end of this project, we will have a solid foundation in handling stochastic processes analytically and computationally. 
#### Embark on this analytical journey with enthusiasm and curiosity. Good luck!
